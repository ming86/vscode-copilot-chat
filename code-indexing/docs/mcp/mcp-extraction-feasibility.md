# MCP Server Extraction Feasibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: PROCEED** with the extraction of VS Code Copilot Chat indexing functionality into a standalone Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

The analysis indicates high technical feasibility, strong market demand, and significant value proposition for individual developers and OSS contributors. This project could democratize enterprise-grade code search capabilities while filling a notable gap in the current MCP ecosystem.

## Technical Feasibility Assessment

### âœ… High Feasibility Factors

**Modular Architecture**: The existing VS Code indexing system is well-architected with clear service boundaries and dependency injection, making extraction technically sound.

**Core Algorithm Portability**: Key components like NaiveChunker, search strategies, and caching systems are largely self-contained and can be adapted to work outside VS Code.

**MCP Compatibility**: The service-oriented design maps naturally to MCP primitives:
- **Resources**: Search results, workspace status, file chunks
- **Tools**: Indexing operations, configuration management
- **Prompts**: Search templates and workspace analysis patterns

### ðŸ”„ Components Requiring Adaptation

**Infrastructure Layer**:
- Replace VS Code file system APIs with Node.js equivalents
- Substitute VS Code authentication with standard OAuth flows
- Convert VS Code progress reporting to MCP notifications
- Replace VS Code settings with JSON/YAML configuration

**Dependency Replacements**:
- `vscode.workspace` â†’ `chokidar` + Node.js fs APIs
- VS Code authentication â†’ Standard OAuth libraries
- VS Code progress UI â†’ MCP notification system
